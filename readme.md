## **Outcome**

## **What I learned**

* Usage of **checkbox's :checked** property to achieve form's pop-out without javascript need
* Effectively utilized the usage of ES6's classes which helps to write less lines of code (instead of Prototyping in Js)
* Quick hack of **static** declaration for **class's methods** to call it without **initialization** of object
* Utilization of **localStorage** mechanism of **Web Storage**
* A lot of minor things
